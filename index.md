## About Me

With *5+ years of cross-functional experience* across manufacturing strategy, battery systems, supply chain consulting, and techno-commercial execution, I specialize in **turning complexity into cost savings, product reliability, and faster time-to-market**. My expertise lies in applying Lean Six Sigma and agile frameworks to solve real-world problems in defence, automotive, and energy sectors.

**Iâ€™ve delivered â‚¹5.6 Cr in annual savings** through workforce optimization, led **29% project cost reductions** via process reengineering, and built **ML-based battery models** improving Li-ion failure prediction accuracy by 18%. My background includes yield enhancement, strategic sourcing, and vendor onboarding in high-compliance sectors like missile propulsion and EV systems.

Outside of work, I lead **Tachorushh** â€” a mobility insights initiative decoding why vehicles succeed or fail in Indiaâ€™s fragmented EV and ICE landscape. I blend consumer behaviour, market analytics, and competitive benchmarking to guide product strategy in the automotive world.
